# Space Invaders

## Purpose

(In no particular order)

1. An experiment to see if I could mimick the classic original video game.

2. To delve into game development with Elm.

3. To improve my Elm skills in general.

## How To Play

Visit <http://www.space-invaders.hollyer.me.uk>

or

```bash
git clone https://github.com/phollyer/elm-space-invaders.git
cd elm-space-invaders
elm reactor
```

## Note

Regarding Touch devices, I have tested this on iPhone 7 and an old iPad Mini. It runs fine on the iPhone, but exceptionally slow, to the point of being unplayable on the iPad Mini.

The nature of the game also means it is easier to play with a keyboard, than on a Touch device.

## TODO

Change the SVG graphics to more resemble the original, with smaller Invaders on the higher rows etc.
